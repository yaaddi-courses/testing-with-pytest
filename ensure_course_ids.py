"""
Assigns a stable, NEUTRAL meta.json "id" to any course folder that doesn't
have one yet — see validate_course.py's own check for why this matters:
without a stable id, renaming a course's folder (or retitling it) later
silently breaks "check for updates" for everyone who already installed it
(the app has no other way to recognize this is the same course under a new
name/folder).

The assigned id is an opaque random token (12 hex chars) — deliberately
NOT the folder name or a slug of the title, both of which can change after
publishing. An id that reads as "obviously derived from the current name"
invites someone to "helpfully" update it to match after a rename, which is
exactly the mistake that breaks existing installs; an opaque token has no
such temptation.

Idempotent and safe to run repeatedly: a course that already has a
non-slug-derived "id" is left untouched, keys are inserted first (Python
3.7+ dicts preserve insertion order) so the file's JSON key order stays
close to hand-written (id, title, description, ...), and only files that
actually needed a change are rewritten (so `git diff`/CI only touches
what's new).

Usage:
    python ensure_course_ids.py                     # assign ids to courses missing one
    python ensure_course_ids.py <course-folder>      # just one
    python ensure_course_ids.py --regenerate-slug-ids [course-folder ...]
        # also replaces any EXISTING id that looks derived from the
        # course's current title/folder name (validate_course.py's
        # id-neutrality warning) with a fresh opaque token. Only safe to
        # run before a course has real installs relying on its old id —
        # this repo is pre-1.0 with no tagged releases, so every course's
        # slug-derived id gets replaced once, then this flag never needs
        # to run again.

Exit code is non-zero if it's ever asked to assign an id that collides
with one already in use (vanishingly unlikely with a random 12-hex-char
token, but checked and retried anyway).
