"""
Validates a course folder against the rules this repo's README/AUTHORING.md
document, and that Yaaddi's own importer enforces — catches the mistakes a
CSV file can't catch on its own: dangling references, missing media, an
exercise with no main card, a too-long prompt, a duplicate card, an
orphaned deck with no cards, low explanation coverage, a main card whose
practice cards are all one type or itself true_false, a course leaning on
too few of the available card types (see KNOWN_TYPES), a course with too
much typing overall, a missing or
duplicate course id, an image (cover or card art) larger than
MAX_IMAGE_DIMENSION, and a course with no narrated (media_card) cards at
all — before you open a PR or import into the app.

No dependencies beyond the standard library.

Usage:
    python validate_course.py <course-folder>            # one course, meta.json checks only
    python validate_course.py <course-folder> --source    # also check source/*.csv directly
    python validate_course.py --all --source              # every course at the repo root

A course folder is expected to look like:
    <name>/
      meta.json
      cover.png            (whatever meta.json's "image" points to)
      source/               (the actual course content — units.csv, cards.csv,
                              meta.csv, images/, media/ — checked via --source)

meta.json's "file" field must point at a real, committed zip in the course's
own folder (see README.md's "Delivery mechanism" note) — a missing file is
a hard error, not a warning: the app fetches it directly from
raw.githubusercontent.com, so a course whose zip isn't actually there is
not installable, full stop.

Exit code is non-zero if any check fails.
